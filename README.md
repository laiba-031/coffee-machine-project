# coffee-machine-project
This project simulates a simple coffee machine using Python. It allows users to choose from three drinks — Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino — while keeping track of available resources and total profit.  The program checks resource availability, processes inserted coins, calculates change, and serves the coffee if the transaction is successful.
